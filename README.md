#Welcome to my website!

This website is my first pet project. It uses a nodejs backend to serve html, javascript, css, and pdfs. The front-end is a reactjs client using redux and react-router bundled using gulp and browserify (some of these projects names may have changed).

The point of this project was just to learn. After getting it running I've learned about all the steps in getting a server up and running. Now I feel confident using nodejs, and am learning more about react and redux. I'm confident you'll see some more projects come up in my github!

There were some changes made recently to clean things up, but if you'd like to access some old url's you still can. While you're there, keep in mind there is a reason I took away the direct links. These pages are not clean or pretty.
